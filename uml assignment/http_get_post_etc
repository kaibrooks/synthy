Specifications for HTTP Get
"Write the specification for the HTTP GET string that will be used by the vaccine
temperature monitor and the database to communicate temperature samples. Be brief
but unambiguous. It should be clear enough that two individuals, one working on
the server side (writing code to parse the string and put the appropriate values
in the database), and another working on the temperature monitor code
(responsible for the code to output the HTTP GET URL string), can do their work
independently and have confidence that when integrated, their code will work together."



The HTTP Get

For example: http://server.url/endpoint/data1_data2_data3_data4

The server located at /endpoint/ shall interpret the string concatenated behind
'endpooint' and use it to update data values.
